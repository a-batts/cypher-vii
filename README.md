Eibert's Quest is a text-based adventure game that is set at William & Mary. You participate in various mini-games that make you
more intelligent, coordinated, charismatic, and more. Or maybe not? We'll see how you pove yourself...

Eibert wakes up suddenly at Griffin's place, only to find out it's 2022. Let's see where you can take Eibert as he navigates a campus that does not know he exists.

### Mini-games dictate the information revealed.
Just like in real life, your skills will help guide you. But you must prove yourself!
For each playthrough of the game, you will be faced with 2 random minigames (increases replayability) to enhance your skill.
The better you do, the more information you'll get during the story.
